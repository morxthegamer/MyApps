        <h1><big>The Will of God</big></h1>
        <p>
            The term ‘will’ in this context is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as ‘
            something desired,’ especially; a choice or determination of one having authority or power.’
            <br>the archaic meaning is “ request, command.”
            We often hear of the will of God for our lives, but do we really understand what it means?
            If we should define this in relation to the<br>aforementioned definition of will, we could safely
            say that it is God’s desire for our lives.

            Now according to the scriptures, we can clearly see that the will of God for many of his
            patriarchs was different. To name a few, let’s look at Abraham and Hosea for example.
            Abraham was<br>given an instruction from God to separate from his family, the Chaldeans, and
            to go to a place that, he the Lord, will guide him towards. Genesis 12: 1-2; Niv “Now the
            Lord had said unto Abram, <br>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
            father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
            will bless thee, and make thy name great; <br>and thou shalt be a blessing”
            I don’t know about you, but just getting up and leaving one’s nativity, one’s roots so to say,
            and to venture into unknown territory can be a fearsome endeavour. But Abraham<br>was very
            obedient and it was clear that he trusted God and was willing to embark on this new conquest.
            This was God’s will for Abraham’s life, who was first known as Abram prior to his name
            change.
